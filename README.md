Experimental Data and Data-processing code for Pendulum and Ball on incline to determine gravitational constant
THis repository contains all pertinent information, including data files, to perform a proper analysis of the gravitational constant using a pendulum
and a ball on an incline experiments. It will also include the finished lab-report that will be written on the subject
